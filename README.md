# Project 1 - Lucas Pyramid
# Problem defnition
An interesting problem in arithmetic with deep implications to elliptic curve
theory is the problem of finding perfect squares that are sums of consecutive
squares. A classic example is the Pythagorean identity:
32 + 42 = 52 (1)

that reveals that the sum of squares of 3; 4 is itself a square. A more interesting
example is Lucas` Square Pyramid :
12 + 22 + ::: + 242 = 702 (2)
In both of these examples, sums of squares of consecutive integers form the
square of another integer.

The goal of this first project is to use F# and the actor model to build a
good solution to this problem that runs well on multi-core machines.
